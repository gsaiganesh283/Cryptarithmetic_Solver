# Cryptarithmetic Solver

Verbal arithmetic, also known as alphametics, cryptarithmetic, cryptarithm or word addition, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. The name can be extended to puzzles that use non-alphabetic symbols instead of letters.

$$ S E N D  + M O R E = M O N E Y$$

The solution to this puzzle is O = 0, M = 1, Y = 2, E = 5, N = 6, D = 7, R = 8, and S = 9.

Traditionally, each letter should represent a different digit, and (as an ordinary arithmetic notation) the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero. A good puzzle should have one unique solution, and the letters should make up a phrase (as in the example above).
