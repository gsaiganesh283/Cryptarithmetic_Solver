# Cryptarithmetic Solver

Verbal arithmetic, also known as alphametics, cryptarithmetic, cryptarithm or word addition, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. The name can be extended to puzzles that use non-alphabetic symbols instead of letters.

$$ S E N D  + M O R E = M O N E Y$$

The solution to this puzzle is O = 0, M = 1, Y = 2, E = 5, N = 6, D = 7, R = 8, and S = 9.

Traditionally, each letter should represent a different digit, and (as an ordinary arithmetic notation) the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero. A good puzzle should have one unique solution, and the letters should make up a phrase (as in the example above).

## History

Cryptarithmic puzzles are quite old and their inventor is unknown. An 1864 example in The American Agriculturist disproves the popular notion that it was invented by Sam Loyd. The name "cryptarithm" was coined by puzzlist Minos (pseudonym of Simon Vatriquant) in the May 1931 issue of Sphinx, a Belgian magazine of recreational mathematics, and was translated as "cryptarithmetic" by Maurice Kraitchik in 1942. In 1955, J. A. H. Hunter introduced the word "alphametic" to designate cryptarithms, such as Dudeney's, whose letters form meaningful words or phrases.

## Types of cryptarithms

### Alphametic
A type of cryptarithm in which a set of words is written down in the form of a long addition sum or some other mathematical problem. The object is to replace the letters of the alphabet with decimal digits to make a valid arithmetic sum.

### Digimetic
A cryptarithm in which digits are used to represent other digits.

### Skeletal division
A long division in which most or all of the digits are replaced by symbols (usually asterisks) to form a cryptarithm.

### Reverse cryptarithm
A rare variation where a formula is written, and the solution is the corresponding cryptarithm whose solution is the formula given.
